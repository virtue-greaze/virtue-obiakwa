#  Heart Attack Analysis using Python

Exploring key patterns and risk factors for heart disease using Python visualization tools.


##  Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset related to heart disease to identify major contributing factors.
It demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and transformation with Pandas  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly  
- Insights for better understanding of health-related data

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly  
- Dash (for interactive visuals)

---

##  Key Insights
- Cholesterol and Age show a strong correlation with heart attack likelihood.  
- Males over 50 tend to have a higher risk based on observed data patterns.  
- Resting blood pressure is another key differentiator among patients.
